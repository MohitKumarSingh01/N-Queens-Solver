# N-Queens Visualization

This project visualizes the N-Queens problem, where the goal is to place `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The solution is visualized step-by-step, showing how each queen is placed on the board while checking for valid moves. The animation speed is adjustable through a slider.

## Features

- Visual representation of the N-Queens problem for any `n x n` board.
- Step-by-step animation of queen placements.
- Adjustable animation speed using a slider.
- Displays the number of possible solutions for each board size.
- Interactive interface with play and pause buttons.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a value for `n` in the input box (where `n` represents the size of the chessboard).
3. Adjust the speed of the animation using the slider.
4. Click the "Play" button to start the animation and visualize the solution process.
5. Click the "Pause" button to pause the animation.
